# OrderedSemigroups

Formalization of Holder's Theorem for semigroups (and for groups).

[Here is more information](https://ericluap.github.io/OrderedSemigroups/) on the project. That page also link to the
[the blueprint](https://ericluap.github.io/OrderedSemigroups/blueprint/) and [the documentation](https://ericluap.github.io/OrderedSemigroups/docs/) for the project.

The formalization follows the paper "On ordered semigroups" by N.G. Alimov and
"Groups, Orders, and Dynamics" by Deroin, Navas, and Rivas.
